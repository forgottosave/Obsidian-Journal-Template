# Journal
This folder contains some of my personal journal entries. If I have time and feel like writing about my life I can do that here.

## Tracker
Additionally, since the beginning of 2024, I track my health and prostrations on each day, using the [[README - Journal#Properties|file properties]]. These are then displayed in the [[Tracker]] file.
To view the [[Tracker]] properly, the Obsidian Community Plugins `Dataview` and `Obsidian Charts` need to be installed and the `Enable Javascript Queries` option needs to be enabled.

## Conventions
#### General
1. File-Properties: as defined in the template [[Journal Entry]]
2. Filename: `YYMMDD - title`
3. `a day in my life` are short Journals of days that aren't really that special and where I don't talk about a specific topic
