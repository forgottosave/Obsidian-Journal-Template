# Personal Journal Template
This is a template you can use as a journal. It supports *daily journals*, *dream journals* & *habit tracking* and even has a cook book integrated!

The [[Tracker]] can be used as a "start page" to your journal, where you can keep an overview over your most important goals and habits. Seeing them every time you open the vault can really help you keep focus on your important goals. 

Enjoy!

## Obsidian
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is the markdown editor that I use to be able to easily visualize, link and structure my Markdown files in this repository. Some views can't render without this program and its plugins (see .obsidian for list of used plugins).
